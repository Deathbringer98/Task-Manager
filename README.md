# Task-Manager

This C++ Task Manager is a console-based application designed to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. It leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create and manage tasks, featuring key functionalities such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, sorting tasks by due date, and saving/loading tasks to and from a file.

# Key Features:
Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed once finished, with an easy lookup by task title.
Sorting: The tasks can be sorted by due date, allowing the user to prioritize based on deadlines.
File Management: The program reads tasks from a file (tasks.txt) and saves any updates back to the file, making the task list persistent between sessions.
OOP Design: The program is structured using classes for better code management and scalability, demonstrating a solid understanding of encapsulation and abstraction.
Purpose:
The Task Manager is ideal for showcasing your C++ skills, especially in:

# Object-oriented programming
File handling (reading from and writing to files)
Basic algorithms (sorting)
Error handling and user interaction
